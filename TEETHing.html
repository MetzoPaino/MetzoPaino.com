              <p class="icon-iconmonstr-twitter-icon">Teething was my attempt to create a game from scratch and release it to the world. Both the music and coding were done by myself, while the art was provided by Robyn Nevison.</p>

							<p>With Teething we have attempted to celebrate videogames of yore with their simplistic, but well refined gameplay and aesthetics. The fast paced gameplay involves guiding a lone tooth around the inside of a mouth, trying to avoid falling sweets for as long as possible.</p>

							<p>To create a seamless feel for the game, and to emulate the constraints of 8-bit games I created everything in one scene with as few actors as possible. This caused some problems, and required a very methodical development approach so that the multiple roles of single actors would not conflict, but I believe that it has provided a very seamless experience.</p>

							<p>To enhance this seamless experience the music is adaptive, with different instruments and pieces playing depending on the actions of the player. To achieve this I composed all of the pieces of music together, and at  the same tempo and key, so the closer the player gets to failing the more intense the music becomes. This was made possible by creating Teething all in one scene, as separating the menus or levels out over different scenes would cause a small, but noticeable interruption to the music.</p>
